## ICP & Buyer Persona Matrix
ICP & Buyer Persona Matrix
<aside>
✅ In this page I show you how you can create a matrix of your ICP and buyer persona in a few simple steps that will help you to create killer messages in your prospecting with high relevance.
</aside>
If you ever found yourself:
❌ Stuck on the outreach personalization
❌ On meetings with unqualified leads
❌ Putting too much effort into deals that end up being too small
Then you should check whom you’re targeting.
Most likely you’re reaching out to the wrong people and that results in low reply and conversion rates.
99% of salespeople face the same problem. They believe that their solution can fit all prospects. That means they can "theoretically" sell to everyone.
The reality is that when you want to sell to everyone, you end up selling to no one.
That's why in this section I'll show you how to define your ICP and buyer persona so that you know exactly how to contact them, create value, generate a need, and potentially close a meeting to sell to them.
❌ When you sell to everyone (poor ICP definition):
Your success rate will be low or close to 0
You’ll be suffering prospecting activities due to lack of focus
You’ll face 100s of rejections and tough objections
The most important, you won’t be able to hit quota consistently.
If you target the right people, you’ll:
✅ Get more replies
✅ Book more meetings
✅ Close more deals
Let’s jump into the practical side:
<aside> 🔥 The better your ICP definition → the more value you’ll provide → the more customers will stick to your message → the more quota you’ll achieve.
</aside>
I’ll show you how you can create a Buyer Persona Matrix to rapidly map the differences between the people you target and adapt the messaging to each of them.
Step 1: Open ChatGPT
Go to ChatGPT and paste the following prompt:
<aside> 🔥 TEMPLATE:
Act as a VP of Sales with 10+ years of experience in prospecting and qualifying customers and generating high-quality meetings and outbound flows.
Now create a 5-column matrix and comparison chart where you define the ideal person/title/role of the ideal buyer persona within the company who can decide, evaluate, and purchase a solution like [company].
[company] VALUE PROP.
This solves pains like:
1
2
3
The main use cases are:
1
2
3
Understanding the value proposition, the matrix should have the following columns:
The title and role of the ideal following buyer persona, e.g. [Define the TITLE]
The 3 biggest challenges and issues of those roles per person in 2024. Please be super specific about this and as concise as possible.
Define the symptoms of those challenges in the same way.
The impact on this person, their KPIs, and the company of these challenges.
The benefit of implementing a solution like [company]
Follow this as a must when executing:
Create everything under the same chart.
Add all the Buyer Personas to the chart. </aside>
Step 2: Add your company details in each variable
<aside> 🔥 EXAMPLE USING REVOLUT COMPANY:
Act as a VP of Sales with 10+ years of experience in prospecting and qualifying customers and generating high-quality meetings and outbound flows. Now create a 5-column matrix and comparison chart where you define the ideal person/title/role of the ideal buyer persona within the company who can decide, evaluate, and purchase a solution like Revolut.
Revolut is a financial solution that allows companies to reduce time and money through an app that allows national and international transactions at a fixed cost and much lower than the competition. It can provide and issue up to 200 digital cards per user at no cost or maintenance to manage expenses and expenses of the company and can be integrated with the digital business to receive online payments.
We focus only on the acquiring, or what's called payments online business unit.
Where you can directly integrate your gateway payment and start selling in your e-commerce.
See money in your account in 24 hours: Get paid directly to your Merchant account with next-day settlement, and no delayed payout schedule.
Accept and settle in 25+ currencies: Go global and take payments in over 25 currencies. We won't convert your card payments unless you ask us to.
Rely on us for reliable payments: Our 99.99% platform uptime means your payments keep going, 24/7 — backed by advanced fraud protection and rigorous security.
This solves pains like:
Lack of gateway payments
expensive fees while selling online
Slow financial cashflow
Understanding the value proposition, the matrix should have the following columns:
The title and role of the ideal buyer persona, e.g. CFO, CEO, Ecommerce Manager, IT director
The 3 biggest challenges and issues of those roles per person in 2024. Please be super specific about this and as concise as possible.
Define the symptoms of those challenges in the same way.
The impact on this person, their KPIs, and the company of these challenges.
The benefit of implementing a solution like Revolut Create everything under the same chart and add all the personas we mentioned above. </aside>
Step 3: Create the Matrix
Example of how it should look like
You can check the full matrix in this link →

A real-life example of how the ChatGPT’s output should look like (check the video below):

Step 4: Differentiate each buyer persona in your outreach
As you can see, if you target CEOs and CFOs, despite the solution being the same at the end of the day, your message must be different.
Understanding their:
Key challenges
The symptom that challenge generates due to not solving it
The impact on their business and KPIs
How they are measured and their responsibilities
How you can tackle those symptoms by solving them and addressing the real problem behind it
Will make you stand out from the other 99% of sellers.
In the following modules, you’ll be able to connect this with the best cold calling and email practices.
But for the time being, the first and most important step is building a robust persona matrix that can help you detach from your features, avoid pitch slapping every time you contact a client, and become a top seller adding value to each contact.
In the following video, I explain to you step by step how I do it myself and the importance this matrix has:

## Boolean Search
1. Use Boolean search
Sales Navigator Boolean search is a simple programmatic language that makes your searches more precise.
It works with a combination of logical connectors and punctuation:
AND
OR
NOT
Parentheses
Quotes
This is a very effective way to refine your search queries and find the leads you are looking for more accurately.
Here is an example:

I searched for “Sales Operations” OR “Sales Ops” here*.*


---

## Account Research
pplyTo: '**'
---

## 🧠 Agent Prompt: Generalized Account Hypotheses Generator

Act as a Senior GTM professional with deep experience in outbound sales strategy. Your role is to generate **3 account-specific hypotheses** that a Sales or SDR team can use to initiate targeted outreach.

You will be given:
- Target **account name**
- Short **company description**
- Known **industry vertical**
- Optional inputs: Tech stack, hiring trends, strategic initiatives, recent funding, expansion news, etc.

---

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE:

Create 3 strong hypotheses for outbound, based on:

1. Clear signals of **pain, change, or growth**
2. Inference from public data or known trends
3. Buyer-relevant insights, **not product features**

Each hypothesis must:
- Be concise (2–4 lines)
- Include the **why now**
- Mention **impact to the buyer/team**
- Link to **common problems solved by modern SaaS/tech**

---

### 🧰 Tools Agent Can Use:

- 🔍 **BuiltWith / Wappalyzer** → to fetch tech stack & tooling
- 📈 **Craft.co / Crunchbase** → company growth & funding
- 🧑‍💼 **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** → hiring trends, org structure
- 📰 **Google News / DuckDuckGo** → recent press/news
- 🧠 **Clearbit / Apollo** → firmographic + enrichment
- 🛠️ [Optional API Connectors] → if running programmatically

---

### 📋 EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

#### 🏢 Account: [Insert Company Name]

1. **Stack Fragmentation from Rapid Growth**
[Company] has scaled quickly across multiple regions. Public signals suggest fragmented tooling and DevOps duplication — a likely inefficiency for Ops or Platform teams.

2. **New Compliance Exposure from Global Hiring**
They've recently expanded into EMEA and APAC markets. Legal or security leads may face new data residency or audit pressure. Worth probing with IT/GRC contacts.

3. **Post-Series B Consolidation**
Following a large Series B round, they’re likely consolidating internal tools. RevOps/IT may now be reviewing system overlap or planning retooling cycles.

---

### 🔑 Guidance:

- Avoid buzzwords like “optimize” or “innovate”
- Make each hypothesis **actionable**, not abstract
- Tailor logic to persona-level concerns: RevOps, IT, Security, Platform, etc.

## Cold Email
Email Foundations
Outbound and Cold Email changed drastically over the years. Doing “spray & pray” worked back in 2019 but not anymore in 2024 and beyond.
Now, relevancy is what we aim for, not just personalization.
Things like [FirstName], [CompanyName], [Industry], or [Role] can personalize an email but won’t make it relevant.
That’s why you need to follow some rules and best practices to stand out in 2024.
<aside>
✅ In this section, you’ll find the foundations and you can move into the following sections to dig deeper into each topic.
</aside>
Golden rules 🥇
<75 words long email
1-4 word subject line all lowercase
Relevant trigger Good reason why you got in touch (What’s in it for them)
Problem focus Address the prospect's problem and symptom (buyer persona matrix), NOT just pains
Key metric loss aversion Show the impact of inaction (COI)
Solution Concise solution to the problem
Short CTA <7 words
Simple language 6-year-old reading level
Line breaks After every sentence
No fluff or unnecessary addings 'Hope you’re doing well'
How to edit ✍️

 1. Subject line
Sound boring
Sound internal
Be about them
Spark curiosity
Simple and direct
Have all lowercase
Easy to understand
Have 1-4 words max
<aside> 📣 Examples:
expenses
expense management
wire transfers </aside>
<aside> 📣 What NOT to send:
[company] + [Company] solution for expenses
Boost your productivity with [company]
Enhance your finances with [company]
Duplicate your margins with Expense Management tool </aside>
2. CTA

 Use interest-based CTAs for the best reply rates, especially in the first emails.

 <aside> 📣 Examples:
Worth a peek?
Sound interesting?
Worth hearing more?
Curious to see more?
Curious to see how?
Something you’re working on?
Are you interested in doing the same?
Open to seeing more? </aside>
3. Follow ups
Don’t stop providing value. I like to add a resource in the p.s.
Address a different problem than your first email.
Avoid anything like ‘hey, just checking in?’ or ‘hey, did you see my last email?’- it’s annoying
Example here

 {{firstName}}, Most [ICP] are trying to [goal/desire]. In 2024, [success case reaching desired KPI doing 1 simple thing]. [solution name]. [soft CTA]? {{signature}} p.s [link value resource to help gain KPI] ———————————————————————— {{firstName}}, Most CFOs are trying to increase their financial margins. In 2024, we helped X increase by 17% their margins while having control over the expense management using Qonto. Worth a peek? {{signature}} p.s Here you can find the 2024 expense management report. Steal it for free!

Below you can find the sentence I use as social proof, the components that should have, and why they are different.
❌ Avoid generic social proof like: “We help companies like yours to improve their communication”
Specific timeline (how fast)
Transformation (specific result — From A → B)
Unique mechanism (with or without)
Subniche terminology
Proof
Talking to a specific avatar/persona

 <aside> 📧 Example 1 — Subniche: Universities → Marketing/Admissions Director

 Copy: In less than 2 years we helped the University of Madrid to increase from 140 to 600 their PhD students, reducing the lead acquisition cost by 73%.

 </aside>

 <aside> 📧 Example 2 — Subniche: Automotive companies

 Copy: We helped Mercedes Benz to 4x their lead acquisition changing their media plans to brand performance in less than 1 year, without increasing their investment in paid ads.

11 tips on how to write a cold email in 2024
Set a buyer persona: Cold emails have to be different for:
C-levels
Managerial
Non-Managerial
Mobile Friendly
4/5 emails are opened on the phone first. Adapt the email with <100 (ideally less than 50) words. They perform 83% better than long emails.
Avoid complex language. Your goal is to make it as easy as possible for prospects to scan the email and understand the idea.
Clear > clever
Use simple words
6th-grade language
Storytelling: People love engaging with stories.
Interrupt the pattern of what all emails look like and avoid sounding like another “template” email.
1-4 subject line.
No clickbait
Keep it boring
Don’t try to sell
Show a new perspective. Don’t be that seller telling them that you can make them save “time and money”. That’s what 99% of your competitors are saying.
Never mention features. Instead, sell the value or desired outcome.
Use social proof. Show them how you helped similar companies to achieve a specific outcome in a specific timeframe.
Clear and soft CTA.
Use PS to personalize.

Cold Email Library
Here you can find a library of cold email templates and frameworks to adapt directly to your business.
This is a library of emails that I put together with my own and external resources that can be used for your benefit.
There are dozens of emails, templates, frameworks, and explanations on why and when to use them.
Remember that these are only examples and should be optimized on a case-by-case basis. All templates can be shorter, more direct, and generate more impact.
Apply everything taught in the other sections of the module to adapt these templates to your case.
<aside>
✅ All the subject lines and copies must be adapted based on ICP, industry, timing, solution, and offer presented.

Cold email Masterpiece

 Sharing one of my best-performing cold email frameworks

 Here it is, line by line:

 1. Personalization or observation: This just gets them to open the email. Subject lines don't really matter in my experience. The first line matters significantly more.

 <aside>

 Example: "I saw on Linkedin...", "I saw on your website...", "Saw on your job description that you're looking for..."

 </aside>

 2. Value Proposition/Unique Mechanism/Problem Statement: Everyone is offering time savings, ROI, etc. This doesn't stand out, try spinning uniquely. Your prospects likely have the same problems.

 Go a step deeper and make this as tailored as possible:

 <aside>

 Unique Mechanism Example: When pitching VPs of sales at SaaS fintech companies, instead of saying "We can help your team to close more deals faster", try "We can help you get 24% more leads in less than 30 days as we did with (competitor)."

 </aside>

 3. (Optional) Summarize Pain Point: Sometimes the pitch sentence isn't clear and ends up being too long. Shorten the pitch sentence, and summarize the pain in the 3rd line.

 <aside>

 Example: "Basically we help X do Y." or “Basically, you can achieve X by doing Y with our help”

 </aside>

 4. Case Study Sentence: Easy enough.

 <aside>

 Example: "XYZ company achieved X result in Y timeframe by doing Z action."

 </aside>

 5. Call to Action: Start soft, crank it up to asking for a meeting directly as you get better results.

 <aside>

 I like to do "Open to learning more" or "May I send a short demo video?" (check for more information)

3 Cold email templates for special occasions

 Ghosting client

 <aside>

 ✅ Situation → You're deep in a deal cycle, but your prospect has gone radio silent despite your follow-up attempts. Try sending them a message that lightens the mood with a touch of humor, and offer them a few easy response options to minimize the effort on their end. This can help break the ice and make it easier for them to get back to you.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template: Subject: not now?

 Hey {first name},

 When I don't hear back for a few weeks, typically it's for a few reasons:
No-Go — you went in another direction + want us to give up
Not Now — not a priority at the moment
You missed the email — Happens all the time, but you're now ready to connect
Mind sharing which reason you fall into, so we can best support the team?

 I'll try giving you a few calls tomorrow, if easiest.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template:

 Subject: Have you given up on the project, [name]? ****Hey {first name} - I didn’t hear from you after our last call.

 Did you abandon the project? Correct me if I’m wrong, but that’s usually what happens if I don’t get an answer in these stages.

 Either way, if you’d like to resume, I’d be more than happy to do it!

 We have a great project between hands based on what we spoke!

 I’ll tell my team to stop working on it in the meantime.

 Best!

 </aside>

 End of Month

 <aside>

 ✅ Situation → If you need to close a deal by the end of the month or quarter, or want to revisit recent lost opportunities, send this email to set up a live call. Keep pricing details out of the email and use them to spark interest. Avoid using this tactic on deals with low chances of closing.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template: Subject: pricing change

 Hey {first name},

 We just got an exciting update from our C-level team with {the timeline you’re referencing} approaching on {specific date}.

 Will be worth the conversation.

 Do you have 5 minutes tomorrow morning?”

 </aside>

 Last try

 <aside>

 ✅ Situation → It’s the last step in a sequence you created and you’re looking for an automated email. Apply some humor to it.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template: Subject: Am I so bad?

 Hi {name}, 11 emails later and STILL no reply... are you on a super long vacation?

 Or perhaps my prospecting skills should just be replaced by AI...

 Any feedback to help me improve is appreciated!

 Best

 The Low Pressure, Data-Backed Cold Email Template

 

 When to Use This Cold Email Template

 Use this template when you have insightful data or metrics you can leverage in the hook. It’ll pique interest and push them toward a response.

 The “AIDA” Approach

 We'll start with a classic cold email template for B2B.

 The AIDA formula encourages sales reps to grab their prospect's Attention, speak to their Interests, arouse their Desire, and entice them to take Action. (That's why it's called AIDA.)

 Here's a quick email example you can use:

 

 This B2B cold email template works because it addresses the prospect's pain points and gives the recipient a way to solve them, i.e., agreeing to a phone call with you.

 The “PAS” Approach

 PAS stands for "Problem, Agitate, Solution."

 First, you address your prospect's problem. Then you agitate it, so the prospect thinks, "Yeah, my life sucks! I need to fix this ASAP!" Once they're frothing at the mouth, you present a solution to their pain. (Hint: the solution is your product/service.)

 Here is a B2B email template you can use to implement the "PAS" approach:

 

 Psychology 101: people make decisions to either avoid pain or gain pleasure. The email above works because it provides a way for prospects to do the former.

 When using the "PAS" approach, hit on one of your prospect's biggest struggles. This cold email strategy will help you achieve the most success.

 The “Right Contact” Approach

 This B2B cold email tactic is uber-popular. I wouldn't be surprised if you've used it in the past to elevate your sales process. Plenty of other sales reps definitely have.

 All you do is ask the prospect if they're the right point of contact. Here's what it looks like:

 

 The “right contact” approach is especially potent when messaging high-level decision-makers. Why? Because you'll gain instant credibility if the CEO of a company passes your email on to a lower-level employee.

 Then, when it's time for the CEO to sign off on a purchase, you'll have name recognition because the CEO has already had contact with your brand. Win!

 The "Problem-Focused" Approach

 If you’re selling something, you’re obviously trying to solve a problem.

 The "problem-focused" approach to cold email strives to catch a recipient’s attention by revealing their issue(s) and claiming you can fix it. Like so:

 

 The email focuses on the prospect's pain points. Then it shows the prospect how the salesperson can take those burdens off their plate.

 When you bring the prospect's problem to the surface, you force them to confront it and decide if they're ready for a solution.

 This template works best when selling painkillers, not vitamins. A vitamin is a nice-to-have product. A painkiller is a must-have product that can make a super meaningful impact.

 The "Curiosity Hook" Approach

 As alluded to above, a solid grasp of psychology will change the way you do sales.

 For instance, one of the best ways to get a prospect to open your message is to pique their curiosity. In other words, if your recipients aren't sure what your email contains, they might be more willing to open it. The fact that they don't know what's inside will eat them.

 The best place to leverage curiosity is in your email subject line. Once you’ve done that, the first one or two sentences must continue to stir up curiosity in your reader.

 The B2B cold email template below illustrates how this could work in the real world

3 Initial emails + Bump Strategy
<aside> 🎯
On this page, you’ll find my VALUE + BUMP email strategy.
You can combine any of the first emails with a bump email to increase response rates.
Make sure they are adapted to your value prop and ICP
</aside>
Initial email (First email of a sequence)
Framework 1
Trigger
Implication + Pain
Social proof (solution)
Interest-based CTA
Template & Example
<aside> 🎯
Structure
Hey [name]
Saw you [relevant trigger], Imagine you’re/thought you’d [implication based on trigger]
Usually, our customers struggle [main problem related to ICP]
So [dig into the pain]
We’ve been helping [social proof]
[positive outcome & how your solution did that]
[Soft CTA]
</aside>
<aside> 🎯
Example
Hey Tom
Saw you're hiring SDRs, I imagine ramping them is a priority.
Most sales leaders struggle to get reps ramped in under 5 months.
This is usually an uphill battle when it comes to hitting the team's quarterly target.
We helped Salesforce’s reps be 100% ramped up in less than <3 months with our methodology.
Worth learning how?
</aside>
Why it works: The opening of the email clarifies your reason for reaching out, demonstrating that you've assessed their situation and can offer an informed perspective. This establishes your credibility.
The latter part reinforces your qualifications to address the challenge by highlighting how you've successfully assisted others. This provides the reader with a tangible sense of the value you bring.
Framework 2
Competitor
Value differentiation

 <aside> 🎯

 Example

 Hey Scott, Saw you're using Salesforce for CRM.

 How are you liking it? I know their product is killer for being organized.

 However, most of their customers switch to us because they need more functionality for forecasting and multichannel inbox management.

 Could you see this being important to your sales team?

 </aside>
Why it works: Reframes the reader’s point of view by discussing the competitor's shortcomings.
Framework 3
Bold Observation
Soft CTC (Call to conversation)

 <aside> 🎯

 Example

 Looks like you're hiring reps, Monica.

 Sales leaders with growing teams usually lean on templates to coach cold calling and cold email.

 Does that sound similar to what you're doing at [company]?

 </aside>
Bump (Follow-Up) Emails
External Resource Bump - 1:
Structure:
Name a resource
Follow the idea of the first email
Share why is valuable
Mention the first email
<aside> 🎯
Example
Rachel, do you read Gong’s blog?
Assuming you’re ramping those new reps, I thought you'd find it interesting.
The VP of Sales Dev at Instantly wrote about how he scaled her team to a $1.1B acquisition.
They did it without using outdated templates.
Any thoughts on my last note?
</aside>
Why this works: Buyers know you’re selling, and branded content often feels biased. Sharing a third-party resource breaks that pattern, building trust on neutral ground. By aligning it with their interests, you make the content more engaging and relatable.
External Resource Bump - 2:
Structure:
Mention numbers and facts
Got back to the original article
Image (if necessary)
Pain link and connection
<aside> 🎯
Example
Rachel, +64% of new reps fail to ramp successfully.
I came across this article by Instantly.
Given ramping your reps is a priority, thought you’d find it interesting.
This trend is only looking to get worse in 2024.
Mind if I share 2-3 tips on how to avoid it?
</aside>
Why this works: Your reader expects a sales pitch, and branded content can seem biased. Offering a third-party resource breaks that expectation, creating trust on neutral ground. By focusing on what matters to them, you engage the reader and foster a sense of safety.
Thoughtful Bump
Structure:
NEVER just say thoughts
Add context + bump
<aside> 🎯
Example
Hey Rachel,
Given that you're growing the sales team, I thought this would be top of mind/worth discussing.
Do you have any feedback on my last message?
</aside>
Why it works: This approach does two key things:
It triggers the reader’s sense of urgency, as no one wants to overlook an important message.
It reinforces that your email is worth their attention by referencing both the context of this message and the personalized original note.
The clarification
Structure:
Restate the context for why you’re reaching out
Seek to clarify part 1: "What we do"
Seek to clarify part 2: "Why that's relevant"
Call-to-conversation (CTC)
<aside> 🎯
Example
Hey Rachel, Given you're growing the sales team, I thought coaching might be top of mind. To clarify, we help sales leaders cut up to 50% of the ramp-up time by doing [specific offer/action]. Does that sound like something you’re tackling at [company]?
</aside>
Why it works: Provides an opportunity to clarify the solution’s relevance to the recipient's challenge.

Personalization

These are best practices you should follow to make sure your emails are both relevant and personalized.
Check the following 3 steps:
Step 1: 2 Rules
Don’t force it No personalization is better than bad personalization. Use it as a tool when it makes sense, too. Use a PS or tie the personalization to your solution smoothly. Don’t randomly throw it in (awkwardly).
Be strategic Consider personalization for your tier-A accounts. Use relevance (previous examples) for the rest.
Step 2: PS
The first strategy for personalization is to simply include it in the PS of your first email. Nothing changes with the rest of the email.
Example: PS - Heard about your Series A, exciting news! Best of luck with your strategic move into the European market. (Basically, add something relevant about them, the market, or the industry)
Step 3: Tie to Solution
The second strategy for personalization is using  to find commonalities between the prospect’s interests and your solution. Then use that information for the start of your first email.
To be clear, but you still have to do a bit of work to make everything sound natural.

## Cold Call
Pitch Foundations & Structure
Before even breaking down each part of a cold call, I want you to have a clear and in-depth understanding of the foundations and structure of a killer cold call.
Then, I’ll share with you all the secrets you need to know to become a cold caller machine

Foundations 👇
Why Listen

<aside> ☺️ Goal: Turn the prospect from being occupied to being curious and get the next minute of conversation. To do it, you have to demonstrate that you have invested time in getting to know about him/her.
</aside>
To differentiate yourself from the typical salespeople, you will do some research and personalize your approach. Moreover, you’ll use some of the following expressions:
I've seen that...
The reason I am calling you is...
I noticed that…
Opener topics List. From most to least personal
Personal Interests found on social media or else on the Internet
Interest in topic via Linkedin: commented on digital topics, posted, following pages
Common point with SDR: same school, past job experience, city, related contact
Recent job change: new role, changed job, new additions to their team…
LinkedIn profile description: mentioned interests, even hobbies
Job experience: X years in charge of ABC, in the industry, managing teams
Job responsibilities (typical of their role): tasks handling, types of customers, relevant challenges
Hiring at the moment for related positions to our prospect.
Company activity on Linkedin: posted about a topic. Unrelated can be useful too
Company-specific products: related to our solution, clearly good target
Company characteristics: industry, size of customers, region
Examples of openers

 Defuse call calling brush-off (for prospects habituated to receive cold calls) "Hi, NAME here. I'm calling you for two specific reasons. Let me give you some context and then decide if it makes sense. Sounds right to you? (More examples later on in the course)

 From a Referral 🚫 "I got your name from REFERRAL"; "The secretary said I should speak with someone from DEPARTMENT"

 ✅ "I just talked with REFERRAL in DEPARTMENT. He/she thought it might be important we should have a conversation. I promised I would reach out to you."

 Company news ✅ " I just read in MEDIA NEWS that you're opening a new plant in CITY"
Why Care

<aside> 😉 Goal: Turn the prospect from being curious to interested. To do it, you have to show them that the solution you’re offering is specifically designed for companies like theirs.
</aside>
You have to show that you have succeeded in working with companies similar to theirs. That's why, you’ll focus your pitch in a way that makes the prospect identify two main things:
Companies you’re working with (as similar as possible)
Success signals: What have you achieved with these companies?
Questions

<aside> 🤔
That's the part where you start qualifying the prospect. You’ll use two different kinds of questions:
Qualifying Questions: Determine whether you want the company as a client or not
Profiling Questions: Determine the maturity level of the client with respect to your solution
** More category questions are explained in detail in later sections*
</aside>
<aside> 💡 Goal: Find how they are currently solving the problem that you help to solve.
</aside>
Why Change

<aside> 😏 Goal: Make the prospect realize that the way they are doing things right now is not the most efficient and that they are missing the opportunity to do it better. (COST OF INACTION)
</aside>
You’ll use what we call Pain Point Questions. These questions will make the prospects tell you how they solve a certain problem while figuring out that they are not doing it in the best way.
<aside> 🏆 The SDR has to try to close the meeting ASAP. There will be prospects that will make the SDRs elaborate more questions and some others will be open to attending a meeting by asking a few of them.
</aside>
Meeting

You should propose a meeting whenever the prospect gets interested in:
How you solve the problem
The pricing
This can happen at the beginning of the call. If the prospect does not ask actively for one of these two things, you can also propose a meeting after the pain point questions if you have seen that there is pain.
I recommend proposing specific dates for the meeting having the calendar of the account executive at hand and scheduling the meeting on the phone.
Example: “Sounds like something we can tackle with our solution. Would it be a crazy idea to jump into a call to discuss this further tomorrow at 3 pm or 4 pm your time”?
<aside> 💡 The meeting should feel like a free class about something the prospect cares about.
</aside>

Structure 👇
Flow Summary:
Opener:

 <aside>

Examples:
"You’re probably going to hate me for this but I’ll be completely honest; this is a sales call."

Pitch:

 <aside>
Goal: Introduce the purpose of the call.
Approach: Mention common issues faced by other clients (CPs).
Decision Point: Does the prospect acknowledge relevance?

"Out of the potential issues, which one is the most pressing?"
"When you say [problem], what do you mean exactly?" </aside>
Reduce the Problem:

 <aside>
Approach: Show understanding and empathy to make the prospect comfortable sharing more details.
Example: “I’m sure your suppliers are doing a great job…” </aside>

Questions to Ask:
"Can you give me an example of that?"
"Do you remember the last time you noticed this was a problem?" </aside>
Impact:

 <aside>
Goal: Understand the significance of the problem.
Questions to Ask:
"Help me understand. What does this mean in your world?"
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how much of a priority is this?" </aside>
Root Cause:

 <aside>
Goal: Explore the underlying cause of the problem.
Questions to Ask:
"How long has it been this way?"
"What else have you done to try and fix this?" </aside>
Summary:

 <aside>
Goal: Recap the conversation and clarify the next steps.
Questions to Ask:
"Let me see if I got this right…"
"Do you mind if I ask a tough question?" </aside>

Decision Point - Product Fit:
<aside>
Product Right for Prospect: If the product can help, propose a meeting.
Phrase: "Would it be a stupid idea to sit down and discuss further?"
Product Not Right or Wrong Timing: If not the right time or fit, wrap up the call positively.
Phrase: "It sounds like this is not a priority. I’ll send you a follow-up email…" </aside>
Techniques to Keep the Conversation Going:
<aside>
Mirroring: Repeat 1-3 of the most important words they say.
Labeling: Acknowledge emotions by saying, "It seems/feels/sounds like..." </aside>
Final Note:
The flow emphasizes a calm, confident, and neutral tone throughout, mirroring the prospect and diffusing any tension by labeling emotions.
This flow ensures a structured, empathetic approach to cold calling, designed to uncover and address the prospect’s pain points effectively.

Cold Call PPVT Framework
The Ultimate PPVT cold calling framework you’ll be able to use, adapt and optimize based on your specific ICP, Buyer persona and industry.
Step 1: Permission Opener (confirmation)

 Objective: Ensure they allow you to speak.

 Script Example:
“Hi, [name]? — Hey, I’m [Name] calling from [Company], you weren’t expecting my call, but if you allow me 20 seconds of your time, I can tell you the reason why I called you and if you don’t like it, we can hang up. I’ll be brief.
Scenarios:
“Go ahead” — Move on to the next step.
“I can’t now” — Understood, should I tell you at least the topic and if it’s relevant I’ll call you back in 2 hours, how does that sound? I know you’ll like what you’ll hear.
Step 2: Pitch (Interest/Curiosity)

 Objective: Understand how the prospect is currently solving the problem your product addresses. That’s why you’re assuming something that you need to confirm with them.

 Script Example:
“Usually, when talking with [title] like you, they are [pain/problem/challenge]. Am I in the right direction?”
Scenarios:
“Yes, we’re facing XYZ problem.” — Progress to the next step. (Dig deeper as much as possible, so the next step will have more impact)
“No. we have that covered, thanks.” — Adjust the approach (ask what they mean or how they solve it) or end the call.
Step 3: Value

 Objective: Present the core problem your product solves.

 Script Example:
“We help [solve the problem] in [specific way]. — We achieved [desired outcome] with [companies/social proof]”
Tip: Move to this step regardless of objections. Keep it brief and focused.
Step 4: Tie-in & Close

 Objective: Relate the value to the prospect's situation.

 Script Example:
“Great well [name] based on what you’ve shared it sounds like [speak about the problem they identified]. We helped [case study] overcome these exact challenges by [explain how they got solved it with your product] leading to [desired outcome] Curious, does this sound interesting to you?”
Set up a sales meeting, not to close the sale.

 Script Example:
“Well look I know you weren’t expecting my call, would you be opposed to scheduling a quick 20-minute call to explore this further and decide if there’s a potential fit? Would [time & day] work for you?
Highlight Next Steps:

 Perfect I’ve got all that booked now, I just sent you a calendar invitation in a confirmation email, could you pleas confirm it so we’re good to go**?**
Pro Tips
Non-verbals are 80% of the call:
Tone —> Consider it as the mood—happy, sad, or fearful. Aim for a casual and confident, slightly informal tone while maintaining professionalism.
Pace —> Slow down your speaking pace, especially if you're new to cold calling. This will show expertise and authority.
Pitch —> ****Avoid sounding overly bubbly or grumpy—aim for balance. Volume matters only if people often ask you to speak up; if you're told you're too loud, it's not a concern.
Be prepared for possible rejection and objections. Know your prospect’s pains by heart. (It’s part of our job)
Remember, the goal of any cold call is to start a conversation, not to sell during those 1,29 minutes. It's about building a connection, understanding needs, and positioning your product for a more in-depth discussion.
What you want is to sell the next step - sell the hell out of the meeting. That’s where your focus should be.
Don’t be too wide, focus on being deep. That’s how you help them understand and acknowledge that they have a pain they need to solve.

Follow a simple plan (your plan):
We all know cold calling isn’t the most fun.
But when done right, it can be truly rewarding.
Making effective cold calls can feel like a daunting task.
From getting your tone just right to understanding your prospect’s challenges, there’s a lot to juggle.
Plus, there’s always that ticking clock.
But despite the challenges, it's still one of the most effective ways to secure meetings.
Let’s dive into some practical tips to help you set meetings over the phone:
1 – Stick to a Plan
<aside>
You need a straightforward game plan for every call.
Familiarize yourself with each stage.
Know how to transition smoothly from the introduction to closing.
A structured approach will help you avoid those uncomfortable silences.
Whether it’s a simple set of steps or a detailed script, follow a clear framework.
</aside>
2 – Nail Your Tonality
<aside>
While your prospect can’t see your body language, they can hear your energy.
Some even say they can hear a smile over the phone.
Tonality is key – it’s not just about what you say, but how you say it.
The wrong tone can make you sound aggressive, dismissive, or too passive.
One helpful technique is to mirror the energy of your prospect.
If they’re energetic, match their enthusiasm. If they’re more reserved, tone it down.
Adapt to where your prospect is at.
</aside>
3 – Play the Long Game
<aside>
Cold calling comes with a lot of rejection.
Embrace it.
Treat it like a numbers game – every "no" is just getting you closer to that next "yes."
Don’t get too caught up in immediate results.
Focus on maintaining consistent effort, and the results will follow.
And that’s all there is to it.
</aside>

<aside>
☎️ There’s no magic rule or formula, just YOUR formula — Stick to it, feel comfortable about calling, and pick up the phone.
</aside>
Call Flow Example
In this case, you’ll find a full example with talk tracks. The example shows a seller prospecting a CFO.
<aside> 🔥 Always adapt the framework and talk track to your ICP.
</aside>
Opener
Concise, clear, and easy to understand.
Go to opener should be one that’s permission-based (like example 1)
The tone should be level (no up tones)
Record yourself on your phone saying it over and over and over again, until it sounds perfect.
Example 1:

 <aside> 📣 Hey Tom - It’s [Name] with [Company]. I know you didn’t expect my call. Do you have a moment? I promise to be brief.

 </aside>

 Example 2:

 <aside> 📣 Hey Tom - It’s [Name] with [Company]. I’ll be upfront with you. This is a cold call about [context]. Do you have 30 seconds to hear why I’m reaching out to you specifically?

 </aside>

 You can check more openers.
Pain validation

 Once you get past the opener it’s critical to show subject matter expertise.

 Time this question and get it to 30 seconds or less. Any longer and you’ll risk losing their attention.

 This is where you show authority and that you really understand what they “might” be facing.

 Example 1:

 <aside> 📣 Typically, when I talk to other CFOs, there’s one thing that’s top of mind: [Pain 1-2] Is that the same for you or is something else more important at the moment?

 </aside>

 Example 2:

 <aside> 📣 Most sales leaders I talk to struggle with knowing in detail [specific pain]. There’s a lot of nuance with [struggle 1], [struggle 2], and [struggle 3] that’s hard to track when it’s done manually in Excel. Does that sound like your world at all?

 </aside>
Meeting booked

 The moment you learn about a challenge or get interested immediately put the meeting in your calendar.

 The sole objective of a cold call is to build interest and book the meeting. Cold calls should not last more than 5 minutes. That’s the main goal, having the meeting on your calendar

 Example:

 <aside> 📣 That’s actually something I hear from a lot of the founders I speak with and something we can help with.

 For context, all you have to do is add your team to the app, set the expense limits, and you’ll be ready to have everything under control in minutes.

 That way you can plan your monthly expenses, send national/international transfers, and have your invoices all in 1 place.

 Would you be open to taking a quick look and seeing how it all works?

 </aside>
Closed + Deep discovery

 After the meeting is booked feel free to ask some discovery questions to pre-qualify the prospect if they are open to speak while closing the conversation.

 The objective of a cold call is to book the meeting. But once a meeting’s booked feel free to ask a couple of questions to set your AE up for success.

 Example 1:

 <aside> 📣 Hey Tom, before you hang up... Do you have a minute for a couple of quick questions so we make the most out of our call tomorrow?

 </aside>

 Example 2:

 <aside> 📣 Hey Tom, while I have you... Mind if I ask 2 quick questions so we get the most out of our call on Friday?

 </aside>

 Example 3:

 <aside> 📣 Hey Tom, before we leave. Can I ask you 1-2 last questions so I can prepare the best meeting for you next Monday?

 </aside>
(Dis)Qualify Fast
Many salespeople are so eager to engage with a potential client that they overlook obvious warning signs (Don’t be this type of seller — You’ll be killing your pipeline!)
This often leads to:
Wasted time
Unmet expectations
Unrealized commissions
That’s why it’s essential to try disqualifying the prospect upfront.
If they truly have a problem or need, they’ll be the first to passionately defend it.
Let them make the case, and only keep the “hot” prospects in your pipeline.
Example
Even if your main goal is just to book meetings (which is a poor sales strategy), you still need to get an example of the problem.
Once you have that example, the problem becomes tangible.
DO NOT ASK FOR THE MEETING BEFORE THIS.
<aside>
Here are a few questions to consider:
When you mention you’re facing {problem X}, can you provide an example of how it shows up in your company?
You mentioned you’re dealing with X; what does that look like in your situation?
Can you share an example of {problem X}?
No example = no real problem.
If they can’t give you an example:
It sounds like this might not be a significant issue after all.
They might push back hard.
If the prospect is in a rush, you might want to move toward closing the meeting
</aside>
Impact
Don’t ask what the impact of the problem is; just don’t.
Instead, try:
<aside>
What would happen if nothing changed?
I’m not sure I understand; what does this mean for you?
Why is this issue such a big deal for you?
You can also ask them to scale the problem:
Just to clarify: on a scale of 1 to 10, how much is this issue affecting your business?
Then, dive deeper by asking:
Why did you choose that number instead of a lower/higher one?
These questions help you gauge whether the prospect genuinely cares about the issue.
If they’re not emotionally invested, they’re unlikely to give you the time to fix it.
At this point, you can downplay the problem:
It doesn’t seem like much would change if things stayed the same.
It sounds like you’re handling things well as they are.
It feels like this isn’t a major issue.
These are all labeling questions. Stay neutral.
</aside>
Again, if they’re in a rush and get emotional, head for the closing.
Root Cause
You might wonder, why bother digging for the Root Cause?
Because people often complain but take no action to solve their problems.
The deeper you go, the more likely they’ll buy instead of just sitting through a meeting.
This is why cold calling is so effective; you can’t get people emotionally invested through email.
Use questions like:
<aside>
What have you done in the past to address this? Why didn’t it work?
Where do you think this problem originates?
You can even propose solutions yourself: have you tried x, y, or z?
This helps you gauge the true depth of the problem.
Be cautious of responses like:
It’s always been this way.
That’s just the way things are.
We’re used to it. </aside>
Gatekeepers : sdr show tell the ai gent to write script for Gatekeeper
The Gatekeeper (GK) is the person that we might encounter on a phone call who decides to pass our call or not to the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
**The GK's job is to protect the ICP from unnecessary calls or distractions.
The SDR's objective is to have a conversation with the ICP, often having to go through, convince, or avoid the GK.**
These strategies will help increase your chances:
🤫 Be brief & keep silent

 Ask your question straight, and don't say anything else until the gatekeeper answers.

 Once you've said the scripted short sentence, just stay silent. Wait for the answer.

 The first to talk loses.

 <aside> ⛔ Typical mistake:
We ask for the person. Short and confident → OK
The GK stays silent while thinking, evaluating if we're worth passing the call or not.
The silence gets us nervous and we start to talk: telling why our call is valuable, how we qualified the ICP, pitching our solution, or something that we shouldn't say.
We boycott ourselves.
The Gatekeeper has no more doubts, blocks us, and doesn't pass the call.
</aside>
🧑‍✈️  Ask the ICP with confidence

 Talk to the GK with confidence. Feel yourself that your call is important, so you can show the GK that your call is important. Therefore, skip the small talk and address the GK directly. It is important to speak with a relaxed and steady voice to sound senior. Give the GK the impression that the ICP is expecting or appreciating your call, to avoid defensive reactions. Avoid saying your company's name and don't introduce researched information about the prospect. Here are some examples:

 Example:

 SDR: “Juan from Finance, please. This is [Name].”

 GK: “What is this regarding?”

 SDR: “The implementation of the expense management solution”.

 If the Gatekeeper doesn’t cooperate, keep firm and direct. Further possibilities:

 GK asks if the ICP expects you: “I don’t have an appointment, but could you please tell Juan that [Name] from [Company] is on the line?”

 If the GK asks you if the ICP will know what topic it is about: “Not specifically, but you can tell Juan it is about [topic]. I am happy to wait in line, thank you.”
👉 Ask for a name, not a job position

 At the start of the call, we must verify if the ICP is the one who answers the phone, by asking the name of the ICP: "Hello, is this Robert?"

 <aside> ✅ If the Gatekeeper answers the call, we will ask for the name of the person, not their job position. For bigger companies, we should also say their last name or the department where they work, so the Gatekeeper can locate them. "Hello, I'd like to talk to Tom (Spencer from Finance)"

 </aside>

 <aside> 🎲 If we don't know the name of our ICP, but someone else in the company, we can mention or refer to that employee if we talked or interacted with them: "Hi, Marc from Marketing told me to get in contact with the responsible for Finance, but I just don't remember the name. Can you pass me through to the Head of Finance please?"

 </aside>

 <aside> ⛔ A typical mistake is to ask for a person for whom we don't know the name, by asking by job position: "Can I talk to the Finance Director?". Or even worse, describing the ICP's responsibilities to the Gatekeeper to help us identify them "I'm looking to talk to the responsible person for Recruiting please, who would that be?"

 </aside>
😈 Create fear. Be unfriendly (at first)

 GKs are moved by two things: On one side, they are afraid to forward a call that the ICP does not consider important or even disturbing. On the other side, they are afraid not to pass on an important call. Use this acknowledgment about the GK to purposely create fear.

 Example:

 SDR: “Hi, who am I talking to?”

 GK: “It’s Ana, who is it?”

 SDR: “Hi Ana, how are you? I am [Name]. I was calling to talk with Juan from Finance.”

 GK: “What is this regarding?”

 SDR: “Look, there are some financial issues with some of the international transactions I would like to talk to him to see how we could manage this.”
😵‍💫 Be complicated but ICP targeted

 The job of the GK is to evaluate if you’re relevant or a waste of time for the ICP.

 When the conversation is getting too technical, probably, they don’t have the expertise to assess whether it’s relevant.


 Make it complicated: Use technical and confusing enough words so it's difficult for the GK to know what are you talking about.


 But it still has to be clear enough so the GK is confident that the ICP is responsible for the topic we are talking about


 Make it focused on the ICP: be sure to mention the department, or the responsibility of the ICP.


 Example:

 GK: “What is this call about?”

 SDR: "It's about international wire transfers within the SEPA region at 0 interest rate, forever." (when it’s actually about sending money)
🤙 Make the Gatekeeper your ally

 Creating trust will improve future call results with the GK. There are different ways you can sympathize with the Gatekeeper:
Show your appreciation, by treating the person with respect, and by being [Name]ite and honest.
Ask for their name and call them by it later.
Repeating their answer also creates the feeling that you are listening and understanding them.
You can also use small talk, asking the Gatekeeper how their day is or mentioning something from your last conversation.
Overall, create the impression of working with them, not above them, making the GK your friend and your ally.

 Befriend the gatekeeper (if the first call doesn’t work). Main steps:
Get their name on the first call
Call again, mention their name, and be friendly.
Make your request once you created rapport
Real example: [After previous conversations with the GK]

 SDR: “Hi, is it Ana?”

 GK: “Yes, who is it?”

 SDR: “Hi, Ana, it’s me, [Name]! How are you? Look, I would like to talk to Juan.

 GK: Oh! He didn’t contact you? I gave him the note…! I will remind him to call you!
🔄 Refer to another person (in the company)
If someone else has already referred you to the GK, be sure to mention their name. This gives the impression that you are talking to the appropriate person and increases your importance. It can happen spontaneously to get this referral, nevertheless, it doesn’t mean that we cannot provoke it, we can contact another ICP (with a high position level) from a different department and get referred.
Example:
EMAIL [Previous email sent to Sofía (Head of Finance)]
Hi Sofía,
I’ve seen that in [Company Name] you are actively executing digital marketing campaigns and that you are actually creating a new website for your brand.
We are a company specializing in marketing automation and I thought it could be interesting for you to have a quick chat about this. Are you responsible for this kind of topic or should I talk to someone else?
Thanks,
EMAIL [Response from Sofía]:
Hi [Name],
Thank you for the email. For this kind of subject, you should talk to Juan, the Head of Marketing.
Call example after the Email
SDR: “Hi, who am I talking to?”
GK: “It’s Ana, who is it?”
SDR: “Hi, Ana! I am [Name]. I was talking with Sofía and she referred me to Juan. Can I talk to him?.”
Handle Objections
<aside>
😈 This page is prepared to equip you with the best frameworks and answers to disarm your prospect’s objection and turn the conversation around in your favor!
</aside>
Framework to follow
1. Pause when listening to an objection
Pause for 2-3 seconds.
Why: It gives you time to think AND slow down.
2. Accept and repeat (if needed)
a. I thought you might say that.
b. Ouch, it must be frustrating to operate without a budget.
c. I’m not surprised, [competitor] is great.
Why: It’s the only way to reduce tension.
3a. Ask for permission
Do you mind if I ask a question about that/one last question?
Why: Asking for permission gives control to the buyer and helps build rapport.
3b. Ask a question right away (or you may lose the conversation)
Why: With very direct objections (like not interested), ask immediately.
Tonality
❌ Sarcasm
❌ High-pitched
❌ Annoyed
✅ Calm
✅ Curious
✅ Cool
Post-Objection
Depending on the answer:
Mirroring the 1-3 crucial words to get the prospect to open up
(Example → Prospect: “Maybe this is not the right time” → SDR: “Not the right time?”)
Label emotions: It sounds/seems/looks/feels
Ask questions to dig into the pain/problem further
If faced with another objection, restart the process
Careful:
These are suggestions only; adapt them to your personality and your world.
Have a conversation; no one wants to be interrogated.
Let’s check the most common sales objections, what NOT to do, and HOW to handle them👇
Call me in 6 months:
❌ Sure, if this is not the right moment, I’ll call you in 6 months.
✅ Understood. May I ask, what will happen in 6 months in the business that will change the situation?
There’s no budget at the moment:
❌ Okay, so [desired outcome] isn’t something you see as a priority right now?
✅ Understood. If we can measure the impact the [solution] would have, the budget constraint could be analyzed again if this becomes a priority?
Don’t have time now:
❌ I don't want to bother. Should I call you later on?
✅ Understood, I called out of the clue. Can I tell you in 15 seconds why I called and if sounds interesting to you I can call you back in the afternoon?
We have a solution in place already:
❌ Let me show you how we are better than your current solution.
✅ Understood. May I ask if there is any use case you’d like to achieve that you can’t with your current tech stack?
We are using [a competitor name]
❌ Alright, but they don’t have ABC and we are better in XYZ.
✅ Great choice, they are really good at [topic]. Mind if I show you how we can do [topic] in a [better way] and you decide if this is aligned with your business expectations?
You’re too expensive:
❌ No worries, we can talk about discounts if you need them.
✅ Got you! If you don’t mind me asking, I’ve seen many different definitions for expensive. Can I ask what’s yours? I’d love to understand the real motivation behind your statement
You’re too expensive:
❌ If you tell me what are you willing to pay, I can do my best to get there.
✅ Understood. Mind if I ask if it’s too expensive compared to another solution you might be looking at, or if I wasn’t able to share the value with you?
Send me an email:
❌ Cool, I’ll send your email and we can move from there.
✅ Actually, that’s why I called. An email can bring more questions than answers. Mind if I share why I called in the first place and you can tell me if it’s worth analyzing more? So I’ll be happy to send you the email.
How your company is better than [competitor]:
❌ We are better in A, they don’t have B and can’t do C
✅ They are great, especially at A. My experience with companies switching from [competitor] to us is great, as they love how we can help them solve [challenges] in [ABC] better ways by doing [XYZ].
We don’t need it now:
❌ Understood, but you consider having [solution]?
✅ You don’t need it now? —> This question will uncover the “real” reason behind the objection
What’s your price:
❌ I can’t tell you now because I’ll need more info for that.
✅ To be as precise as possible, I’ll need more information for that. But based on our conversation and your needs, I can tell you with my experience in similar projects, that could be between A and B.
In the following chart, you can find different ways to approach some of the same objections
A great way to handle an objection is to start with:
“I hear that all the time and totally understand. Actually, that’s why I called…” and you give the reasoning behind the call, and you handle the objection.
In most cases, the objection means they want you to go away, so it’s important to dig deeper what’s the real meaning of what they are saying to you.

## Discovery Call Prep
8 Common mistakes to avoid (Disco)
Prompt

Act like a sales leader expert in the b2b sales SaaS field - with +10 years of experience running discover calls.

I'm struggling to define what questions to ask when running a discovery call.

I want you to give me a chart or a matrix with the best discovery calls to ask. I want the chart to be divided into Impact questions, critical event questions, decision questions, pain questions, and closing questions.

Each part should have 5 questions, why they are important, and the reason/motivation behind those questions.

Please, create a second chart with the main 10 questions I should never ask in a discovery call if I don't want the prospect to go away and the reason why I shouldn't use them.

Make them all on the same chart
Objective

Rules
Avoid these 8 mistakes and your discovery calls will be better than 95% of sellers.

✅ You’ll feel and see why these mistakes are killing your discoveries and deals. Once you go through all of them, you’ll find inside this Module a proven process for you to follow and never lose a discovery call again!
</aside>
Mistake #1 - Not preparing before the call

 The Mistake:

 <aside>

 When I check calls from my team I can tell immediately if someone’s prepared or not.

 Guess what? So can your buyer. Showing up and going through the motions doesn’t win competitive deals. All it takes is 15 minutes to come in as a professional. And someone who’s well prepared, consultative and actually brings something to the table.

 </aside>

 The result:

 A poor and super generic experience:

 <aside>
Asking questions your SDR or you already asked before.
Asking questions like “What brought you to ABC Company?”
Asking questions like “does that make sense?”
Providing the same horrible experience as your competitors.
Losing deals to “no decision” “price” or “went with a competitor” due to not provide any value. </aside>
How to solve this:

 Take 10-15 minutes before the call to:

 <aside>
Review company news, the person you’re meeting with, other stakeholders you’ll need to speak to, CRM notes, SDR notes, what tools they are using, why they should care about your solution, etc.
Show up with a hypothesis of how you’ll help, your first question, discovery questions, and the next step you want to define.
Drive the conversation and differentiate yourself as a seller by being consultative, researched, and well-prepared. </aside>
Mistake #2 - Not having a Point of View

 The Mistake:

 Asking buyers open-ended questions that don’t show that you’re a subject matter expert.

 Some examples:

 <aside>
Can you tell me about your role?
What are your top challenges?
What are your top priorities?
This puts all the work on the buyer and doesn’t position you as a trusted advisor.

 Ultimately, buyers are coming to you for your expertise and guidance, not to hold your hand throughout the entire process.

 </aside>

 Never ask a question you can find the information online beforehand!

 What do to instead:

 Give your buyer options that demonstrate you know what you’re talking about. Always guide with a story (storytelling) and give a clear reasoning for why you’re asking that specific question.

 <aside>

 For example: Hey [name], Thank you for sharing. I speak with [role] in your situation every day. Usually, they’re dealing with a couple of things:
Challenge 1 & 2.
Is that what you’re experiencing or is something else more important at the moment?

 </aside>

 One way or another you win:

 <aside>

 No matter what happens after you provide options (based on your expertise and research) you win.

 They’ll either agree. Which gets you instant credibility as someone who knows their stuff.

 Or they’ll disagree. And let you know what’s really happening. Even if that happens you still come across as knowledgable. And can focus the conversation on the buyer’s priorities and challenges.

 </aside>
Mistake #3 - Missing priorities and challenges

 The Mistake:

 Spending the entire first call:

 <aside>
Not doing much discovery and talking mostly about themselves and what the company does. (This shows you’re not prepared)
Mainly asking qualification questions. ie questions that only benefit the seller and not the prospect. Such as how many people do you have? What’s your timeline? What’s your budget? (This will kill your discovery) </aside>
The entire point of discovery calls is to learn the buyers’ #1 priority and the key challenges they’re facing. So you can best position your solution and win competitive deals.

 It’s not about you, it’s about them.

 Options are a great resource:

 Again, this is the best way to focus the conversation on their #1 priority and key challenges.

 You can follow this talk track:

 <aside>

 I speak with [role] every day in your situation and usually

 they’re focused on the following:
Priority 1 & 2 </aside>
Is that the case for you or is something else more top of mind?

 Quick wins and best practice:

 This is all a lot easier if you take the time to write down the key priorities and challenges of each persona you work with.

 <aside>

 Make sure to listen to call recordings so you can use their exact words and phrases (This will have an emotional impact).

 You can also interview closed/won customers or internal personas to get this information.

 If there’s one thing to spend time studying and mastering this is it. As you can tell, it impacts every single phase of the buying journey.

 </aside>
Mistake #4 - Losing control of the conversation

 The Mistake:

 <aside>

 Letting the customer take full control of the conversation. In practice, this looks like the buyer peppering the seller with question after question after question.

 After answering each question the seller paused and not saying anything.

 The buyer then takes this as a signal to keep asking questions so that’s what they do.

 By the end of the call, there’s no understanding of the #1 priority or key challenges.

 You are in charge of the discovery, you need to lead with smart questions, and you need to be the one showing expertize.

 </aside>

 How to keep control:

 To do so, you need to:
Answer their question (if they ask any).
Immediately roll into a question about their priorities and challenges.
Tie their questions to the priority and challenge you mentioned before.
For example:

 <aside>

 Hey [name] - Great question. [answer here].

 Now you mentioned earlier that you you were looking to X [related to that question].

 Can you share more about that?

 </aside>

 Another example:

 <aside>

 Buyer:
Hey, how does X work?
Hey, can you do X?
Hey, how can I do X workflow?
You (Seller):

 Great question.

 Short answer: Yes.

 I’ll make sure to circle back with more details but first, it’d helpful to understand a couple of things so I’m only speaking to what’s most relevant to your business.

 Would it be ok for me to ask a couple of quick questions about [priority/challenge]?

 </aside>
Mistake #5 - Try to ask every single question

 The Mistake:

 <aside>

 Treating discovery as a one-time event and trying to ask every single possible question into one call.

 The conversation feels like a 30-minute interrogation and not an organic and consultative conversation.

 Asking too many process-related questions that are better asked right before showing a feature on the demo.

 Exhausting the buyer and ultimately not building a compelling case to move forward.

 </aside>

 Discover during the demo as well:

 Save some process-related questions for the demo.

 One of the best demo flows:

 <aside>

 Asking about how they’re currently doing something. Learning those challenges, and then immediately demonstrating how it’d work on your platform.

 So don’t ask every process question on the discovery call. And spend most of the time focusing on the buyer's #1 priority and the key challenges they’re facing.

 </aside>

 Qualification always in the end:

 Most sellers do the following:

 <aside>
Ask a bunch of qualification questions.
Don’t spend much time talking about the buyer’s priorities and challenges.
Flip that around:

 Come in having a conversation about what people are typically:
Looking to accomplish
Struggling with
At the end of the call ask “Would it be ok if I asked a couple of quick questions to set our demo up for success?

 </aside>
Mistake #6 - Not digging deeper

 The Mistake:

 <aside>

 Most of the time sellers only get surface level details about something and quickly move on.

 I’ve seen a lot of cases where a buyer will even say “This is our #1 priority” or “This is a key challenge we’re facing”.

 And instead of digging deeper and talking about that, the seller quickly says “ok great we can definitely help with that” and then moves on to the next question that’s on their list. (THIS IS WRONG)

 You need to master the ability to go beyond surface-level details and get the context needed to win competitive deals.

 Not digging deeper will take you just to sell what most sellers sell:
“We can help you save time and money” → This leads to a LOST DEAL </aside>
Options are a great way to do it:

 If they say “ramp-up is important” that’s only a surface-level detail.

 Use options to dig deeper:

 <aside>

 Hey [Name], I speak with [role] every day and when they’re focused on speed for their global team ramp-up process.

 Usually, that means:
Deeper priority/challenge 1 & 2
Is that the case for you or is something else more important at the moment?

 </aside>

 Questions you can use:

 <aside>
"Tell me more...."
"Can you share more about..."
"What's a specific example of...." “I'm interested in learning more about..."
“Can you offer more insight into...”
"I'd love to dive deeper into that; could you share more about..."
“You mentioned X... mind walking me through that in more detail so I have the full picture...”
"Mind shedding more light on..." </aside>
Mistake #7 - Not multithreading

 The Mistake:

 <aside>

 There are two mistakes with multi-threading on discovery calls:
Not using processes to naturally see if any other people should be invited.
Not doing some research ahead of the call and mapping out who you’ll need to speak with, assuming all things go according to plan.
Ultimately, this results in weak multi-threading attempts at best such as:
“Should we involve another colleague in the process?” </aside>
Instead, follow a process:

 When you talk about a specific process ask the buyer if they own it or someone else on their team does.

 <aside>

 “Hey [name] - are you the only person responsible for X process or does someone else on your team have a part as well?”

 When you talk about what will be covered in the demo use that as a natural way to involve other people. “Hey [name] - Since we’ll be walking through X process on the demo should we invite [colleague] and get his/her perspective?”

 </aside>

 Do your research:

 This is one of the most common mistakes sellers make:

 <aside>

 Not mapping out who you’ll probably need to speak with if all things go according to plan.

 Instead of “Who should we involve?” ask something like this instead:

 “Hey [name] - On the demo I’d like to walk through X process as it relates to [#1 priority].

 Given that, should we invite [colleague] to the call?

 Noticed he’s your [specific role] and it’d be great to get his perspective since X process will impact his workflow.”

 </aside>
Mistake #8 - Not defining the next steps
The Mistake:
There are 3 critical mistakes I see sellers make when it comes to setting next steps:
<aside>
Not setting the next steps and instead giving access to the platform and saying some form of “let me know if you have any questions!”.
Putting all the work on the buyer by asking some form of “What do you think would make sense as a next step here?”
Failing to set the next steps altogether because the discovery was not compelling. </aside>
Follow this framework:
Here’s a process can you use. It has 4 steps:
<aside>
Tell a story that shows why there is a compelling case for a partnership (build interest).
Ask if you can make a recommendation on the next steps (take control).
Communicate what the next steps will be (have a plan).
Most importantly share WHY those next steps will be valuable (make it compelling). </aside>
Write it down:
Whatever you do, don’t wing it when it comes to next steps.
<aside>
Write down all the most common next steps you can take with a buyer and the talk tracks you use for them.
Write down the next step you’re looking to set ahead of the call assuming all things go well.
Most importantly, make sure you watch the clock and reserve at least 5-7 minutes to set the next steps and multi-thread.
If you do these things you’re going to be able to set a call as the next step consistently and effectively.
</aside>
Discovery Structure & Talk Tracks
First things first, let’s have a clear breakdown of a 30-minute discovery call structure.
You can adapt this to your type of discoveries, and the length of it. The important point is to cover all the steps.
<aside>
✍️ Let’s check the step-by-step process you should follow to nail your discovery call.
</aside>
Agenda + Quick Overview
<aside>
🚫 AVOID “non-sense” small talk at all costs! (Except for some exceptions or specific cases)
</aside>
From 16% to 30% is the percentage of the discovery call you lose if you spend 5 to 8 minutes making small talk.
At the end of the day the buyer’s coming to you to help with their priorities and challenges. Focus on that right from the start.
Setting the agenda:
Outbound opportunities are fundamentally different than inbound opportunities.
The buyer doesn’t know much (if anything) about your company and their priorities and challenges are not as urgent.
So you have to treat them differently:
Use an agenda
Give a quick overview of your company and how you help customers.
Then get into discovery and learning about their priorities and challenges
Example:
<aside>
Hey [Name] - Appreciate you taking the time.
On this call, I’d love to start with a quick 2-minute overview of what we do at Acme so you know how we generally help our customers.
From there, I’d love to learn more about yourself, what piqued your interest in taking this meeting, and the key items your org is working on.
If there’s alignment we can walk through the platform and chat about how we can go about solving your key goals and initiatives.
Is there anything else would you’d like to cover today?
</aside>
Another example:
<aside>
Thanks for your time. The purpose of this call is to walk you through how we can help you [Value Prop].
To do so, I'll be asking you some questions to learn [use case]. Is that fair?
That said, I already shared the agenda via email but let's review it here: We'll cover [Agenda items 1, 2, 3], and finally, [next step]. Anything you'd like to cover that I may have missed?
We have 30 minutes scheduled, do you have a hard stop?
Great, at the end of this call, we will decide what the [next step] should be. Either moving forward to a demo or shaking hands as we might not be a fit for you, no hard feelings!
Does that sound fair?
</aside>
Now you jump into the quick overview to start your discovery call
Quick overview:
Since outbound leads don’t know your company that well.
Here’s a quick framework you can use to describe how you help your customers:
Share a researched observation
Describe how you usually help
Transition to their business
Do this to:
Break the ice
Explain how you help
Demonstrate subject matter expertise.
Make this overview as fast as possible — Less than 2 minutes is the sweet spot
Example:
<aside>
Hey [Name] - I did some research and noticed [observation].
So typically we help our customers like yourself who’re focused on:
Priority 1 & 2 (short and sweet description)
Before I spend too much time talking about what we do I want to make sure everything’s relevant to you and your business.
Can you talk to me about your team, challenges, and the overall landscape on your end, if that’s ok?
</aside>
For Inbound leads
Since inbound leads are coming to you with priorities and challenges they’re looking to solve.
You can get right down to business skip the agenda and start asking about those things.
No seller does this and it’s a great way to respect your buyer’s time and differentiate yourself from the competition.
If you feel comfortable with setting an agenda, go for it, but keep it short and direct to the point (less than 2 minutes) so the prospect knows what to expect from the call.
Example:
<aside>
Hey [Name] - Appreciate you taking the time. I want to make sure we get the most out of our call today.
So I'd like to start with my research, what I know about your business and how I think we may be able to help.
How does that sound?
</aside>
Questions + Discovery
The first question to ask
Research-based questions: This will show you as an expert. Will let them know that you did your research and that you have a story to tell
Whatever you do, don’t start calls with questions like “What brought you to meet with us today?”. That’s ok but it puts all the work on your buyer and 90% of sellers ask vague open-ended questions like that.
Instead build trust and momentum with your customer by showing you’re thoughtful, a professional, and that you did some work already.
Example:
<aside>
Hey [Name], excited to speak with you today because I did some research and noticed [tell specific research].
What else would you add, if anything?
</aside>
Example 2:
<aside>
Hey [Name], excited to chat with you today because I spoke with my colleague [name] and he mentioned [SDR notes].
Did I get that right and what’s important for me to know about your business and what you’re looking to accomplish?
</aside>
The second question to ask
Try to nail and uncover the main and most important priority
To do that, you can use options, this is a great workaround to uncover the real reason why they are listening to you
After your first question, your buyer will open up and share some high-level details about their business.
The best thing to do after that is to:
Summarize what you heard
Ask a question with options that are focused on their #1 priority
Please, avoid open-ended generic questions like “Tell me about your priorities”.
Example:
<aside>
Hey [Name], thank you so much for sharing.
Here’s what I’m hearing [summary and recap]. Did I miss anything?
I work with a lot of founders in your situation and usually they’re focused on a couple of things:
Priority 1 & 2
Is that the case for you or is something else more important to your business with this project?
</aside>
Jump into Discovery
When preparing your discovery (or demo), you can follow this that will help you to understand deeply your prospect, their company, the competitors you have in the process, and how to differentiate your solution from others.

Now that you understand your prospect, you can use options, as mentioned before, to nail the real problem and priority they have, instead of just staying at surface level.
When a prospect shares a high superficial level answer, do this:
<aside>
Hey [name] - Appreciate you sharing.
I work with [role] every day in a similar situation and usually, it means they’re focused on a couple of things:
Priority 1 & 2
Is that what you’re experiencing or am I in the wrong direction?
</aside>
When a prospect shares a specific goal, do this:
<aside>
Hey [Name] - You mentioned X was a goal.
I speak with [role] every day and usually, that means they’re dealing with a couple of things:
Priority 1 & 2
Is that what you’re experiencing or is something else more top of mind when it comes to [insert their goal]?
</aside>
Once you find a real and details problem and priority, dig deeper there.
That’s when you start using process-based questions
Ask your buyer questions about their processes that are:
Aligned to their #1 priority.
Lead directly to your differentiators.
Two great CTAs:
When you need to X what happens?
Have you asked anyone about X? That’s an important question because...
Example: They mentioned the cost is a priority — So you say:
<aside>
Hey [Name] - You mentioned earlier that cost is your #1 priority when it comes to [process].
Given that, I’d love to learn how you’re analyzing X solutions to make sure they solve the right problem within your financials.
When you need to run a comparison analysis, what happens?
</aside>
Now you need to start digging deeper into the problem and priority.
Avoid high-superficial answers at all costs.
You need to understand what’s going on in the business that can lead to hiring your services
We’ll cover more real examples and strategic questions in the next step of this Module!
Defining the Next Steps
If there’s no next step on the books your deal is significantly less likely to close.
Before every call: write down the next step you’re going to recommend - assuming everything goes to plan.
<aside>
3 Steps when setting the next steps:
Step 1 → Describe the next step
Step 2 → Share the WHY it’s valuable to do it that way
Step 3 → Suggest a clear next action (date, time, and what to do) </aside>
What NOT to do when defining the next steps:
Leave it up to the buyer: “What do you suggest as the best next step?”
Not setting a call: “I’ll send you an email giving access to our platform and a scheduling link if you’d like to book more time with me.”
This is exactly how you lose a deal from minute 0!
Example:
<aside>
Hey [Name] - Looking at the clock we have about 5 minutes left.
I’ve really enjoyed our conversation and I’m confident that we can help you to [achieve priority 1 and solve challenges 1 & 2].
Based on that, may I make a recommendation here on the next steps?
Great. Here’s what I’d recommend: A 60-minute product deep dive where we’ll walk through the workflows for X, Y, and Z as it relates to [challenges 1 & 2].
Does tomorrow same time work for you?
</aside>
Now it’s time to multi-thread.
Before your discovery call. Go on Linkedin and research what end users, you’d like to try and get on the demo.
When you propose the next steps include their name and why it would be valuable for them to join.
Example:
<aside>
Hey [name] — On the demo, I’d like to walk through X process as it relates to your #1 priority of X.
Given that, should we invite [colleague name] to the call?
Noticed he’s your [role] and it’d be great to get his perspective since X process will impact his workflow.
What do you think?
</aside>
Discovery Frameworks & Questions
<aside>
✋ Stop winging from one question to another in your discovery calls and start following a proven system and frameworks that increase your conversion rates.
That’s why you can combine the following 2 methodologies I used to become the top closer in every org I worked.
It’s a combination of my own sales discovery methodology, SPIN selling, and some bonus questions you can ask on top.
</aside>
Questioning is a vital skill for sales reps, as it helps them uncover the needs, challenges, goals, and preferences of their prospects.
There are different types of questions that sales reps can use in different stages of the sales process, depending on the purpose and the desired outcome. Here are some common types of sales questions and when to use them:
Open-ended questions:
<aside>
Require detailed responses. Useful for building rapport, discovering pain points, and exploring goals.
Example: “What are you looking for in a solution?”
</aside>
Closed-ended questions:
<aside>
These can be answered with yes/no or short responses. Useful for confirming details and narrowing options.
Example: “Do you have a budget for this project?”
</aside>
Probing questions:
<aside>
Dig deeper into motivations, challenges, and goals. Useful for uncovering root causes and the impact of issues.
Example: “Why is this issue important to you?”
</aside>
Leading questions:
<aside>
Suggest a direction or answer. Useful for guiding the prospect toward a desired outcome.
Example: “Don’t you think our solution would save time and money?”
</aside>
Rhetorical questions:
<aside>
Don’t require an answer, used to emphasize a point or provoke thought.
Example: “What if you could double your sales in six months?”
</aside>
Hypothetical questions:
<aside>
Ask the prospect to imagine a scenario or result. Useful for stimulating imagination and evoking emotions.
Example: “How would your day look with our solution?”
</aside>
Scale questions:
<aside>
Ask for a numerical rating on satisfaction, interest, etc. Useful for quantifying feelings and identifying gaps.
Example: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with your current solution?”

6 Questions System
You’ll find 6 questions that will help you easily boost your average deal size by finding bigger deals, uncovering bigger problems, and establishing clearer priorities, faster.
<aside>
✅ These are must-ask questions, with real templates & examples, and WHY they are so important you can’t forget about them.
</aside>
Question 1

 <aside>

 I talk to [your industry] leaders all day long. They tell me about their heartburn around problems 1, 2, and 3. How much of that sounds like your world & what did I miss?

 </aside>

 Example:

 <aside>

 "Usually, when Sales leaders join these calls they usually want to either A or B. • They have hiring freezes, but quotas are not going down.

 • They're facing double-digit growth metrics. And not sure how they're going to hit them.

 • They are seeing Pipeline dry up in these market conditions. And so they're looking for a new channel.

 Curious how much of that sounds like your world? And what did I miss?”

 </aside>

 This question does 3 things:
Immediately establishes credibility - you already know the common problems they’re facing, so they see you as an industry leader and expert. And are relieved they don’t have to educate you at all.
Lowers friction (they don’t have to think up an answer from scratch - they can pick from multiple choice) — We mentioned how giving options is key!
Gets you detailed answers (it leaves room for them to correct you. People love to correct others… they especially love to correct salespeople. They want to go into detail.)
Question 2

 <aside>

 So you're looking to change or improve {{XYZ metric}}...by how much?

 </aside>

 Example:

 <aside>

 “Sounds like increasing pipeline is the #1 priority. By a couple of hundred thousands or tens of millions? 9% or 49%?”

 </aside>

 Why it works:

 Getting a specific metric vs. just “improve this metric” will help you keep urgency throughout the deal. You will reference this when asking for follow-up meetings or if momentum starts to slow down.

 “You mentioned your team needs to increase the pipeline by 39% by Q2. If it needs to be implemented by Q2, should we meet with your Ops team next week to do the setup overview?”
Question 3

 <aside>

 Happy to answer [question on a feature]. Sounds like you have a specific reason for asking?

 </aside>

 Example:

 <aside>

 “Smart question. Sounds like [feature] may be important for your team. You probably have a specific reason for asking?

 </aside>

 Why it’s important to ask:

 Sometimes people ask about a product feature because they hope you DO have it.

 Sometimes people ask about a product feature because they hope you DON’T.

 We always want to figure out why they’re asking before we answer.

 Don’t rush to say YES before asking this!
Question 4

 <aside>

 You just mentioned {{XYZ pain}}.... what's causing that to be prioritized?

 </aside>

 Example:

 <aside>

 “It sounds like reducing churn is top of mind for you. There’s usually a story there. Curious what’s driving that for you?”

 </aside>

 Why is this important:

 Executives are always putting out multiple fires. What’s causing this fire to take priority? (It’s likely been an issue for a while.)

 What you’re looking to uncover here is

 • A specific initiative related to a problem you solve

 • A target metric (26% improvement, etc)

 • A time-bound event (by Q3)
Question 5

 <aside>

 How widely felt is this pain across your whole organization? A few teams or a top 3 strategic priority?

 </aside>

 Example:

 <aside>
"These days it's harder than ever to bring on new tech. I’m seeing across all my clients that to bring on something new, we have to align with a specific departmental or company OKR. Otherwise, it goes nowhere."
"In your opinion, which priority do we best align with?"
"Who's responsible for the success of that priority?"
"What's the best way to get them involved?" </aside>
Why is this important:

 Problems can be urgent to 1 manager and non-existent for another. Problems for executives that have ripple effects across departments… those are the ones that get prioritized and solved.
Question 6

 <aside>

 How will others in your org feel about using something like {{my product}}?

 </aside>

 Example:

 <aside>

 “Typically something like this creates either excitement or concern, or both. Curious to hear your prediction on how this might go down for your team?”

 </aside>

 Why is this important:

 Every initiative will have allies. And adversaries. Asking about this (early & often) will help uncover 2 things:
Who will transparently give you inside intel.
Who to engage & who to watch out for.
Follow-ups to send
<aside>
✅ In this section you’ll find the templates and examples you should use before and after having a discovery call.

5 Ps to measure
<aside>
✅ After each discovery/demo, you must answer as many of these questions as possible, which are considered the 5 Ps.
</aside>
To find out how healthy the deal is and how feasible it is to close the opportunity, you should have a clear and strategic answer for each question.
If you don't find answers to these questions, it means that you still have a lot to discover before jumping to price, to avoid ghosting or falling into a price war and not a value war.
The 5 Ps stands for Pain, Power, People, Process (theirs), Process (ours) — Includes a Bonus Risks & Risks Mitigation category.
Let’s check them out👇
Pain
What is the (quantifiable) business pain you are solving for the customer?
What is the impact of that pain (if not solved)?
What is their goal?
Where is the information coming from?
Power
Who has the authority to release the funds and who will sign the deal?
Who is the true economic buyer? Where is the money coming from?
Do we know some or have connections to some people who are high in the organization?
Where is the information coming from?
People
Who is your champion? How do you know they are a champion? What does each care about?
Who are important influencers? What does each care about?
Who are the lend of other people we are working with on this deal? In what way is each involved? What does each care about?
Where is the information coming from?
Process (their buying process)
What steps do they as a company need to make to get to a buying decision?
Do we have something in place (Compelling event, specific customer urgency, pilot expiration, or other) that will drive the timeline?
Have we asked the client if they’ve thought about an appropriate range of investments to solve their problem? How do they plan on funding this?
Do we understand the decision criteria for the people involved in the decision-making steps?
Are they looking into other competitors as well?
Where is the information coming from?
Process (our sales process)
What specific next steps do we have in place with the customer? How will it move the deal forward?
Risks & risk mitigation
What are the largest 1-3 risks in the deal?
How are you going to mitigate the largest risks?
<aside>
👀 Make sure you follow the proven systems explained in Discovery + Demo Modules so you can answer all these questions after each meeting with your prospects
</aside>
Discovery Call Checklist
<aside>
✅ This checklist will help you to map out how you should be running the discovery call. If you follow this structure and you’re able to tackle each of these steps, you’ll be running a highly professional discovery call.
</aside>
Step 1 — Discovery
What’s their #1 priority?
What are their key challenges?
Use option-based questions.
Hey [name], I work with a lot of [role] in your situation and usually they’re focused on a couple of things:
Priority 1 & 2 — short description
Is that what you’re experiencing or am I in the wrong direction?
Step 2 — Differentiation
How do you help?
How’s that different?
Why do the differences matter?
If you want to win large competitive deals (at a premium) you need to differentiate your product.
Why else would someone spend more for something?
This story needs to be told throughout your sales process so everyone understands why you’re the partner of choice
Step 3 — Next Steps
What’s the exact next step?
Why’s it valuable?
Who else should be included?
Prep this ahead of time, including the people who should be on the demo, and make a recommendation.
Save 5-7 minutes and watch the clock. Don’t be afraid to stop while in the middle of something.

## Sequence Orchestration
Cold Email Library
Here you can find a library of cold email templates and frameworks to adapt directly to your business.
This is a library of emails that I put together with my own and external resources that can be used for your benefit.
There are dozens of emails, templates, frameworks, and explanations on why and when to use them.
Remember that these are only examples and should be optimized on a case-by-case basis. All templates can be shorter, more direct, and generate more impact.
Apply everything taught in the other sections of the module to adapt these templates to your case.
<aside>
✅ All the subject lines and copies must be adapted based on ICP, industry, timing, solution, and offer presented.
</aside>
Cold email Masterpiece

 Sharing one of my best-performing cold email frameworks

 Here it is, line by line:

 1. Personalization or observation: This just gets them to open the email. Subject lines don't really matter in my experience. The first line matters significantly more.

 <aside>

 Example: "I saw on Linkedin...", "I saw on your website...", "Saw on your job description that you're looking for..."

 </aside>

 2. Value Proposition/Unique Mechanism/Problem Statement: Everyone is offering time savings, ROI, etc. This doesn't stand out, try spinning uniquely. Your prospects likely have the same problems.

 Go a step deeper and make this as tailored as possible:

 <aside>

 Unique Mechanism Example: When pitching VPs of sales at SaaS fintech companies, instead of saying "We can help your team to close more deals faster", try "We can help you get 24% more leads in less than 30 days as we did with (competitor)."

 </aside>

 3. (Optional) Summarize Pain Point: Sometimes the pitch sentence isn't clear and ends up being too long. Shorten the pitch sentence, and summarize the pain in the 3rd line.

 <aside>

 Example: "Basically we help X do Y." or “Basically, you can achieve X by doing Y with our help”

 </aside>

 4. Case Study Sentence: Easy enough.

 <aside>

 Example: "XYZ company achieved X result in Y timeframe by doing Z action."

 </aside>

 5. Call to Action: Start soft, crank it up to asking for a meeting directly as you get better results.

 <aside>

 I like to do "Open to learning more" or "May I send a short demo video?" (check for more information)

 </aside>
3 Cold email templates for special occasions

 Ghosting client

 <aside>

 ✅ Situation → You're deep in a deal cycle, but your prospect has gone radio silent despite your follow-up attempts. Try sending them a message that lightens the mood with a touch of humor, and offer them a few easy response options to minimize the effort on their end. This can help break the ice and make it easier for them to get back to you.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template: Subject: not now?

 Hey {first name},

 When I don't hear back for a few weeks, typically it's for a few reasons:
No-Go — you went in another direction + want us to give up
Not Now — not a priority at the moment
You missed the email — Happens all the time, but you're now ready to connect
Mind sharing which reason you fall into, so we can best support the team?

 I'll try giving you a few calls tomorrow, if easiest.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template:

 Subject: Have you given up on the project, [name]? ****Hey {first name} - I didn’t hear from you after our last call.

 Did you abandon the project? Correct me if I’m wrong, but that’s usually what happens if I don’t get an answer in these stages.

 Either way, if you’d like to resume, I’d be more than happy to do it!

 We have a great project between hands based on what we spoke!

 I’ll tell my team to stop working on it in the meantime.

 Best!

 </aside>

 End of Month

 <aside>

 ✅ Situation → If you need to close a deal by the end of the month or quarter, or want to revisit recent lost opportunities, send this email to set up a live call. Keep pricing details out of the email and use them to spark interest. Avoid using this tactic on deals with low chances of closing.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template: Subject: pricing change

 Hey {first name},

 We just got an exciting update from our C-level team with {the timeline you’re referencing} approaching on {specific date}.

 Will be worth the conversation.

 Do you have 5 minutes tomorrow morning?”

 </aside>

 Last try

 <aside>

 ✅ Situation → It’s the last step in a sequence you created and you’re looking for an automated email. Apply some humor to it.

 </aside>

 <aside>

 💬 Template: Subject: Am I so bad?

 Hi {name}, 11 emails later and STILL no reply... are you on a super long vacation?

 Or perhaps my prospecting skills should just be replaced by AI...

 Any feedback to help me improve is appreciated!

 No-Ask Outreach Email

 

 When to Use This Cold Email Template

 Use this template when you have a big "ask," but haven’t established a relationship with the prospect yet. It provides value—without asking for more than a response.

 "Can I Send You Ideas?" Cold Email

 

 When to Use This Cold Email Template

 This email works particularly well for service-based companies with deep industry expertise, but it can be adapted to most scenarios.

 The Low Pressure, Data-Backed Cold Email Template

 

 When to Use This Cold Email Template

 Use this template when you have insightful data or metrics you can leverage in the hook. It’ll pique interest and push them toward a response.

 The “AIDA” Approach

 We'll start with a classic cold email template for B2B.

 The AIDA formula encourages sales reps to grab their prospect's Attention, speak to their Interests, arouse their Desire, and entice them to take Action. (That's why it's called AIDA.)

 Here's a quick email example you can use:

 

 This B2B cold email template works because it addresses the prospect's pain points and gives the recipient a way to solve them, i.e., agreeing to a phone call with you.

 The “PAS” Approach

 PAS stands for "Problem, Agitate, Solution."

 First, you address your prospect's problem. Then you agitate it, so the prospect thinks, "Yeah, my life sucks! I need to fix this ASAP!" Once they're frothing at the mouth, you present a solution to their pain. (Hint: the solution is your product/service.)

 Here is a B2B email template you can use to implement the "PAS" approach:

 

 Psychology 101: people make decisions to either avoid pain or gain pleasure. The email above works because it provides a way for prospects to do the former.

 When using the "PAS" approach, hit on one of your prospect's biggest struggles. This cold email strategy will help you achieve the most success.

 The “Right Contact” Approach

 This B2B cold email tactic is uber-popular. I wouldn't be surprised if you've used it in the past to elevate your sales process. Plenty of other sales reps definitely have.

 All you do is ask the prospect if they're the right point of contact. Here's what it looks like:

 

 The “right contact” approach is especially potent when messaging high-level decision-makers. Why? Because you'll gain instant credibility if the CEO of a company passes your email on to a lower-level employee.

 Then, when it's time for the CEO to sign off on a purchase, you'll have name recognition because the CEO has already had contact with your brand. Win!

 The "Problem-Focused" Approach

 If you’re selling something, you’re obviously trying to solve a problem.

 The "problem-focused" approach to cold email strives to catch a recipient’s attention by revealing their issue(s) and claiming you can fix it. Like so:

 

 The email focuses on the prospect's pain points. Then it shows the prospect how the salesperson can take those burdens off their plate.

 When you bring the prospect's problem to the surface, you force them to confront it and decide if they're ready for a solution.

 This template works best when selling painkillers, not vitamins. A vitamin is a nice-to-have product. A painkiller is a must-have product that can make a super meaningful impact.

 The "Curiosity Hook" Approach

 As alluded to above, a solid grasp of psychology will change the way you do sales.

 For instance, one of the best ways to get a prospect to open your message is to pique their curiosity. In other words, if your recipients aren't sure what your email contains, they might be more willing to open it. The fact that they don't know what's inside will eat them.

 The best place to leverage curiosity is in your email subject line. Once you’ve done that, the first one or two sentences must continue to stir up curiosity in your reader.

 The B2B cold email template below illustrates how this could work in the real world
